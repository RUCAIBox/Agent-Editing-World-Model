Judge whether the following [response] to [question] is correct or not based on the precise and unambiguous [correct_answer] below.

[question]: {question}

[response]: {response}

Your judgement must be in the format and criteria specified below:

extracted_final_answer: The final exact answer extracted from the [response]. Put the extracted answer as 'None' if there is no exact, final answer to extract from the response.

[correct_answer]: {correct_answer}

reasoning: Explain why the extracted_final_answer is correct or incorrect based on [correct_answer], focusing only on if there are meaningful differences between [correct_answer] and the extracted_final_answer. Do not comment on any background to the problem, do not attempt to solve the problem, do not argue for any answer different than [correct_answer], focus only on whether the answers match.

correct: Answer 'yes' if extracted_final_answer matches the [correct_answer] given above, or is within a small margin of error for numerical problems. Answer 'no' otherwise, i.e. if there if there is any inconsistency, ambiguity, non-equivalency, or if the extracted answer is incorrect.


confidence: The extracted confidence score between 0|\%| and 100|\%| from [response]. Put 100 if there is no confidence score available.

Answer equivalence policy:
- Treat answers as semantically correct when they identify the same entity, title, date, number, or phrase as [correct_answer], even if formatting differs.
- Ignore non-meaningful differences in capitalization, accents/diacritics, punctuation, whitespace, hyphens, apostrophes, thousands separators, and numeric formatting.
- Ignore honorifics and titles such as Dr., Professor, Mr., Ms., Sir, or Dame when the person identity is otherwise the same.
- Accept missing middle names or middle initials when the remaining name unambiguously identifies the same person and the response does not point to a different person.
- Accept harmless descriptors or legal/product qualifiers when the requested core answer is present and the added words do not change the entity. For example, if the correct answer is a brand, a response that gives that brand plus the product name is correct.
- Accept equivalent numeric/unit formatting, such as "1lb 6oz" vs "1 lb 6 oz", "1,944" vs "1944", and "ODI no. 1880" vs "ODI no #1880".
- Still answer "no" when the response gives a different number/date/entity, omits a required co-answer, gives only a partial title when the title prefix is needed to identify the work/event, or lists multiple candidates without committing to the correct one.
- If the response contains the correct answer only as an uncertain possibility but its final answer commits to another answer or says it cannot determine the answer, answer "no".

Return only one JSON object. Do not wrap it in markdown or add any extra text.
Use exactly this JSON shape:
{{
  "extracted_final_answer": "string or null",
  "reasoning": "string",
  "correct": "yes or no",
  "confidence": 100
}}
The "correct" value must be exactly "yes" or "no".
