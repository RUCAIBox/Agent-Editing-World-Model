# ── BeyondSWE: Non-search prompts ───────────────────────────────────────────


DOC2REPO_PROMPT = """I need you to implement a software repository from scratch based on a strict architectural specification.

### 1. Context & Environment
* **Workspace Directory**: `{workspace_dir}`
* **Current File Structure**:
```text
{workspace_tree}
```
* **Installation Status**: The `target_repo` package is already installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`). Any changes you make inside the `target_repo/` directory will be immediately reflected in the environment.

### 2. Environment & Dependency Management
The repository will be installed and evaluated using `pip install -e .`. You must manage dependencies strictly via `setup.py`.

<CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT>
The following packages are **ALREADY INSTALLED** in the environment. You can use them directly without reinstalling:
```text
{installed_packages}
```
*(Note: Do not assume any other packages exist unless listed above.)*
</CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT>

<DEPENDENCY_RULES>
1. **Setup.py is King**: You MUST list all necessary runtime dependencies in `setup.py`.
2. **Avoid Redundancy**: If a package is already in **<CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT>**, do **NOT** add it to `setup.py` unless you absolutely need a different version than the one installed. This prevents network timeouts and conflicts in the evaluation environment.
3. **Pin New Dependencies**: If you need a package that is **NOT** in the list above, you **MUST** add it to `setup.py` and **explicitly pin the version**.
4. **Ignore requirements.txt**: Do not create or update `requirements.txt`. Only modify `setup.py`.
</DEPENDENCY_RULES>

### 3. The Specification (`repo_document.md`)
This document is the **Absolute Authority** for the **Architecture, Public API, and Logic**. You must implement the repository exactly as described here.
```markdown
{REPO_DOCUMENT}
```

---

### 4. Task Instructions

**Phase 1: Analysis & Research (Critical Discipline)**
* **Analyze the Spec**: Read `repo_document.md` to deduce the required directory structure and class hierarchy based strictly on the **Import Paths** defined in the document.
* **Check Dependencies**: Compare spec requirements against <CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT>. Decide which ones need to be added to `setup.py` and which ones are already present.

**Phase 2: Implementation**
* Implement the **Public API** and **Core Logic** described in the document inside the `target_repo/` directory.
* **Strict Constraints**:
    * Function signatures (arguments, types, return values) MUST match the document exactly.
    * Ensure all imports use relative imports (e.g., `from . import utils`) or absolute imports starting with `target_repo`.
* **Internal Implementation Flexibility**:
    * The document lists the **Core Public API**. You are encouraged to create necessary **private helper functions**, **internal constants**, or **utility classes** to support the logic.
    * **Guidelines**:
        * Keep internal helpers private (prefix with `_`) where appropriate.
        * You may create new utility files inside the `target_repo/` directory if the logic requires it, but **do not abuse this**—keep the structure clean and logical.
        * Do NOT change the signature of the documented Public APIs.

**Phase 3: Verification (Self-Correction)**
* Since this is a clean-room implementation, **NO existing tests are provided**.
* You are responsible for verifying your own code:
    * Create a standalone script (e.g., `verify_implementation.py`) to import your new classes/functions and assert they behave as documented.
    * OR write simple `pytest` cases to check critical logic.
* **Goal**: Ensure your implementation runs without errors and matches the spec before you finish.

**Phase 4: Submission**
* Once you are confident:
    1. Delete any temporary verification scripts (`verify_implementation.py`) to keep the repo clean.
    2. Ensure `setup.py` is configured correctly according to <DEPENDENCY_RULES>.
    3. Submit your work using the "finish" tool.

   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.
   1.5 Highlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue

Phase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository
   2.1 Follow the readme to understand the setup, BUT assume the pre-installed environment is the source of truth.
   2.2 WARNING: Repositories often rely on fragile binary dependencies (C/C++/Fortran). DO NOT run `pip install` or upgrade packages (numpy, pandas, gdal, etc.) unless strictly necessary. You might break the environment.
   2.3 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests. You should realize that NOT achieving a 100% passing rate is normal in this environment due to missing optional dependencies. If failures occur, you should assess whether the failed pytest and the problem statement are related, and then run the relevant tests for the problem statement accordingly.

Phase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions
   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.
   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.
   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.

   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.
   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.
   4.3 If the issue requires external services (e.g., external interface connection, specific Solver, GPU) that are missing in this environment:
       - DO NOT spend time trying to install heavy external services.
       - Mock the external service in the reproduction script.
   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.

Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it
   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.
   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.
   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.
   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.

**Phase 1: Analysis & Constraints (Spec Compliance)**
* **Analyze the Spec**: Read `repo_document.md` to deduce the required directory structure and class hierarchy based strictly on the **Import Paths** defined in the document.
* **Check Dependencies**: Compare spec requirements against <CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT>. Decide which ones need to be added to `setup.py` and which ones are already present.
* **Strict Constraints Protocol**:
    * **Spec > Internet**: Do NOT use the Search Tool to find "better ways" to implement the logic. The logic described in the document is the ground truth.
    * **No "Defensive" Deviations**: Do not change return types, argument names, or data formats unless the document explicitly asks for them.
    * **Search Usage Limit**: Use the Search Tool **ONLY** if you encounter:
        1.  Syntactical errors related to specific library versions (e.g., `pydantic` v1 vs v2 differences).
        2.  Missing imports or dependencies that are implied but not listed.
    **MANDATORY Deep Reading**: If a search result looks promising, you **MUST** use the **`web_fetch`** tool to fetch and read the actual page content. Treat search snippets merely as relevance indicators. Snippets are often incomplete or outdated. **Never write code based solely on search snippets.**
    * **Do NOT search** for the project name or architectural patterns described in the spec.

**Phase 2: Implementation**
* Implement the **Public API** and **Core Logic** described in the document inside the `target_repo/` directory.
* **Strict Adherence**:
    * Function signatures (arguments, types, return values) MUST match the document exactly.
    * Ensure all imports use relative imports (e.g., `from . import utils`) or absolute imports starting with `target_repo`.
* **Coding Strategy**:
    * **Minimalism**: Implement exactly what is requested. Do not add unrequested features, "future-proofing," or complex error handling that isn't specified.
    * **Internal Flexibility**: You may create private helper functions (`_helper`) or internal utility modules if the logic requires it, provided they do not alter the Public API.

**Phase 3: Verification (Rigorous Testing)**
* Since this is a clean-room implementation, **NO existing tests are provided**.
* **Mandatory Pytest**: You MUST create a standard test file (e.g., `tests/test_verify.py`) and run it using `pytest`.
    * **Do NOT use a simple print-script**.
    * Write explicit `assert` statements to verify:
        1.  Class signatures and method existence.
        2.  Return types and data formats.
        3.  Critical logic paths (e.g., hash chaining consistency, graph connectivity).
* **Refinement**: If `pytest` fails, analyze the error. If the error implies a conflict between your code and the spec, **fix the code to match the spec**.

**Phase 4: Submission**
* Once you are confident:
    1. Delete the temporary `tests/` directory to keep the repo clean.
    2. Ensure `setup.py` is configured correctly according to <DEPENDENCY_RULES>.

   1.2 Highlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.
   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.
   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.
   1.5 Highlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue.
   1.6 **Dependency Version Check (CRITICAL)**: Identify the key external libraries involved (e.g., pandas, scipy, internal solvers). Do not assume the environment matches the latest online documentation.
   1.7 Identify any domain-specific concepts, mathematical formulas, scientific theories, or other related information mentioned in the <issue_description> that require external verification. List the specific search queries you plan to use to acquire this knowledge.

Phase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository
   2.1 Follow the readme to understand the setup, BUT assume the pre-installed environment is the source of truth.
   2.2 WARNING: Repositories often rely on fragile binary dependencies (C/C++/Fortran). DO NOT run `pip install` or upgrade packages (numpy, pandas, gdal, etc.) unless strictly necessary. You might break the environment.
   2.3 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests. You should realize that NOT achieving a 100% passing rate is normal in this environment due to missing optional dependencies. If failures occur, you should assess whether the failed pytest and the problem statement are related, and then run the relevant tests for the problem statement accordingly.

Phase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions
   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.
   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.
   3.3 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.
   3.4 You can use the **Search Tool** to proactively research the domain knowledge or other useful information:
       - If the issue involves a library error, Search for the error message + the **installed version** (found in Phase 1.6).
       - If the issue involves an API change (e.g., "Xpress 9.4"), explicitly Search for **"Release Notes"** or **"Migration Guide"**.
       - If the issue involves a scientific formula, Search for its **official definition** or **paper**.
   3.5 **Attention**:
       - **MANDATORY Deep Reading**: If a search result looks promising, you **MUST** use the **`web_fetch`** tool to fetch and read the actual page content. Treat search snippets merely as relevance indicators. Snippets are often incomplete or outdated. **Never write code based solely on search snippets.**

Phase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.
   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.
   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.
   4.3 If the issue requires external services (e.g., external interface connection, specific Solver, GPU) that are missing in this environment:
       - DO NOT spend time trying to install heavy external services.
       - Mock the external service in the reproduction script.
   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.

Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it
   5.1 State clearly what the problem is, specifically citing official documentation, API references, or scientific principles found during the search phase to justify your fix.
   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located. Explain **WHY** your proposed fix is correct.
       - If fixing an API misuse, cite the official documentation or search result.
       - If fixing a formula, cite the physical definition found.
       - **Do not guess** hidden parameters or black-box behaviors; refer to your discovery or Search results.
   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.
   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.
   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.

Phase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.
   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.

Phase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.
   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.
   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.
   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.
       - Ensure you haven't broken other features.
       - If a scientific value changes, verify if the new value is actually correct according to domain principles, not just "different".

8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit {base_commit}.
   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.
   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:
     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing
     8.2.2 The files you modified
     8.2.3 The functions you changed
   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass. Verify that you have not introduced execution errors (like ImportError) by modifying dependencies. The code must run in the original environment state as much as possible.

Be thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.
