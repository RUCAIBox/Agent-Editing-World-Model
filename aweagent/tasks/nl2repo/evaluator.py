"""NL2RepoEvaluator — evaluates an NL2Repo agent submission.

Faithful port of the original NL2RepoBench post-processing pipeline
(``openhands/post_processor.post_process_task`` →
``run_test_commands`` → ``analyze_pytest_results``), with the same
tar-based workspace handover. This evaluator does **not** use ``git`` anywhere —
some sandbox runtimes don't ship it.

Pipeline (aligned with the official flow):

1. The agent session (run by the ``TaskRunner``) tars its workspace
   into ``workspace.tar.gz`` and hands the bytes to this evaluator
   through ``instance.metadata["_agent_artifact"]``.

2. Evaluator boots a fresh container from the per-instance evaluation
   image (``Instance.metadata["eval_image"]``), which already contains
   the project's source and golden tests under ``{workdir}``.

3. Upload the tarball to ``/tmp/workspace.tar.gz`` and extract it into
   ``/tmp`` — producing ``/tmp/workspace/...`` (matches the official
   ``COPY workspace /workspace`` layout).

4. Strip package-management files (``setup.py`` / ``pyproject.toml`` /
   ``requirements*.txt`` / ...) from ``/tmp/workspace`` (recursively).
   Same rationale: the base image ships the canonical packaging files
   so the test environment has the expected dependencies.  This mirrors
   ``post_processor.remove_package_files``.

5. Strip agent-written variants of the golden test paths
   (``py_test_file_list``) from ``/tmp/workspace`` so that when we
   overlay onto the container's ``{workdir}`` the base image's golden
   tests survive byte-identical.  This is the direct analogue of
   ``post_processor.remove_test_files`` + ``COPY``: the agent cannot
   ship an adversarial ``tests/test_evil.py``.

6. Overlay ``/tmp/workspace`` onto ``{workdir}`` with ``cp -r``.  Files
   only present in the agent's tar are added, files also present in the
   base image are overwritten by the agent's version, and files
   deleted in steps 4/5 keep the base image's golden copy.

7. Run each shell command in ``test_shell`` sequentially inside the
   container under ``{workdir}`` with
   ``PYTHONPATH={workdir}:$PYTHONPATH`` (matches the official
   Dockerfile ``ENV PYTHONPATH=/workspace:$PYTHONPATH``).  Failures are
   caught per-command and reported as synthetic ``exit_code=-1``
   entries so transient runtime errors don't abort the whole
   evaluation.

8. Score with the byte-for-byte port of ``analyze_pytest_results``:
   regex-sum ``(\\d+) passed`` / ``(\\d+) failed`` / ``(\\d+) error``
   across every pytest command's output, compute
   ``success_rate = min(passed/total, 1)``.
