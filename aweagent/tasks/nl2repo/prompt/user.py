"""NL2Repo user prompt templates.

Ported **verbatim** from the original NL2RepoBench OpenHands launcher
(``openhands/openhands_app.py`` lines 200-201).  This is a single-line user
prompt with no placeholders — keeping it byte-identical to the upstream
benchmark is the only way to guarantee that the LLM sees the exact same
instruction string and that downstream evaluation numbers stay comparable.

    "`uv add/install <target>`, `poetry add <target>`, "

    "dependencies your own implementation needs (e.g. `pip install "
    "requests`) and you may run `pip install -e .` on the code you "
    "yourself wrote, but the target package itself must never be "
    "fetched. Violations will be detected automatically by the "
    "execute_bash tool's security policy and blocked."
