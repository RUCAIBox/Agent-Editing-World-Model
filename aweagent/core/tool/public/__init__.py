"""Public tools — tools that call externally hosted services over HTTP.

Unlike ``core/tool/code`` (which act through a :class:`RuntimeSession`
container) and ``core/tool/search`` (web search/fetch backends), tools here
talk to standalone services the operator deploys and points the tool at via
environment variables. They need no runtime session.
