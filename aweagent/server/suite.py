"""Eval server — programmatic entry point for scoring a checkpoint on benches.

``evaluate()`` is the surface the AutoTrain outer loop calls: given a served
checkpoint (an OpenAI-compatible sglang base_url) and a set of benchmarks, it
runs each bench through the shared pipeline and returns per-bench scores.

Serving is out of scope by design: this layer never launches sglang. The caller
(or an external system) is responsible for serving the checkpoint and passing
its ``base_url``. AweAgent's sglang backend is a plain HTTP client.
